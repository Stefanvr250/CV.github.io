For the website I built, i used mainly HTML and CSS. The only java script i used was to for smooth scrolling and to automatically go to the top of the website when the page is reloaded.
I used multiple sections to discern the different "tabs" which contain my skills and project, about me and the contact me part of the page.
The CSS was used to highlight the different sections via different colors. I also used CSS to transition the text from transparent to visible when the page loads.
i used bitbox to get the icons for the linkedin, github and home buttons.
